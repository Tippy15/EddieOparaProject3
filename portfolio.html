        <div class ="AboutOmaha">
            <p>A logo was created that consisted of three <br> circles and bars to create an abstract <br> monogram and is meant to portray <br> performance. It allows to logo to move, play <br> and dance like the performances seen on the <br> stages.</p>

        <div class ="AboutCoqual">
            <p>The objective of this branding was to create a <br> visual personality that was bold and demanded <br> to be seen. This was achieved with a custom <br> drawn wordmark and a condensed typography. New symbols were created as well to invoke a feeling of currency or factor of exchange.
